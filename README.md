# vibe-3d.space
----------------------------------------------
## 1. Background and Overview
[vibe-3d.space](https:vibe-3d.space) is born out of my daily necessity for ultimate vibes. Whether it be coding at a cafe, building product at a jazz-themed WeWork, or getting some late night work done with lo-fi girl studying on my other monitor, I require immaculate vibes to get into my flow state. Therefore, I wanted to create a website that immerses the user into a 3D atmosphere where they can listen to a curated embedded playlist as well as turn on ambient background noises as if they are at a NYC rooftop jazz cafe, highly influenced by http://imissmybar.com/ but taking it a step further with the interactive 3D experience. The user can look around using arrow keys or the mouse all within the browser. 

I hope that [vibe-3d.space](https:vibe-3d.space) can serve as a nice companion to vibe with wherever you are.
## 2. Functionality and MVP
The functionality for the first MVP will be simple in that the user will immediately be immersed into the 3D environment upon visiting the site. The user can use arrow keys or the cursor to look around the environment which will be set at a NYC jazz cafe (will later add other atmospheres like Tokyo, LA, etc.). There will also be floating sliders that can control how much ambient noises the user wants (ex. people talking in the background, street sounds, etc.). Curated Spotify playlists will be embedded on the screen to change playlists at anytime.
